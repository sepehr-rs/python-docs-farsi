scripts/unstage_cosmetic.py

Unstage (and revert) any currently-staged file whose only diff is the
`POT-Creation-Date` header line. Ported out of the nightly workflow's
inline bash/awk step so the manual version-bump script can produce the
same minimal, noise-free diffs (item 3) -- previously only the workflow
did this, so a human running update_python_version.py and committing
with `git commit -am` would bake pure-timestamp churn into history,
which then became a spurious baseline for the *next* nightly diff too.

Usage:
    python scripts/unstage_cosmetic.py

Must be run with a git repo that already has changes staged (e.g. after
`git add --all`).
